FIXUPS

Some applications are known to not be compliant with the XMLTV specifications,
or have other peculiarities in the way they interact with the grabber output.
Users of those applications should request that the developers correct their
implementation or add the required additional functionality they desire and
then migrate to those fixed versions, but there are cases where that cannot
be accomplished quickly.  To address this issue, this grabber will recognize
a request for fixups in an environment variable.

Fixups are intended to be a temporary measure.  It is imperative that users
work with the developers of their application to release an updated version,
and that one updates to that release.  While it is a goal that a fixup be
supported for at least a year after the application has been identified as
being non-complaint with the XMLTV definition or that the application does
not provide the desired functionality, if code changes or refactor in this
grabber impact the ability to support a fixup, the fixup may be removed
sooner.

NOTE: Requests to add fixups should include a patch or pull request.

The environmental variable is TV_GRAB_TARGET_APPLICATION_FIXUPS and the
requested fixups are separated by a colon.

Example usage:

    TV_GRAB_TARGET_APPLICATION_FIXUPS=NO_XMLTV_NS_TOTAL_SEASONS:NO_PREVIOUSLY_SHOWN_ZONE_OFFSET tv_grab_zz_sdjson_sqlite

Currently implemented fixups:

    NO_XMLTV_NS_TOTAL_SEASONS

        Do not add in the total seasons value to season value in the xmltv_ns
        episode numbering.

        Known apps: MythTV master before 585f509 (fixes/0.28 before e26a33c)

    NO_PREVIOUSLY_SHOWN_ZONE_OFFSET

        Do not add in the zulu offset for previously shown.

        Known apps: MythTV versions before ff5ab27 (legacy unsupported versions)

    NO_STATION_LOGOS

        Do not add the station logos/icons to the generated result.  This is
        (mostly?) useful when an individual has carefully curated a set of
        logos and the application will replace them with the logos provided
        by the xmltv provided values without further user interaction.

        Known apps: MythTV (feature request posted)

    NO_MULTIPLE_STATION_LOGOS

        Only return the first station logo/icon.  This is mostly useful
        when the app chooses the last, rather than the first, logo when
        presented with more than one logo.

        Known apps: MythTV before 96e307a (legacy unsupported versions)

    NO_ACTOR_GUEST_ATTRIBUTE

        Do not emit the guest attribute for actors even for actors
        identified as guest stars/voices.

        Known apps: None (but there are likely some apps which need the fixup)
